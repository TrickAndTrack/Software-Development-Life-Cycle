The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software that meets customer expectations.
This methodology consists of a series of steps that divide the software development process into multiple stages.

Below are the steps of SDLC:
1. `Planning` :
First stage of SDLC is all about “What do we want?” Project planning is a important step in the software development lifecycle since this is the part where the team estimates the cost and defines the requirements of the new software.

2. `Requirements Gathering & Analysis` :
The second step of SDLC is getting the maximum information/requirements from the client for the product. Discuss each detail and specification of the product with the customer. The development team will then analyze the requirements keeping the design and code of the software in mind. Then looking into the validity and possibility of developing these requirements into the software system. The main goal of this stage is that everyone understands the detail of the requirement.
Documents created in this stage is SRS (Software requirement specification)

3. `Design`:
In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software. For example, make technology choices, and identify development tools. They will look at how to best integrate the new software into any existing IT infrastructure the organization may have.
High Design level -> Overall system architecture or design of the application Generally created by the Project Architect 
Low Design level -> Module level design of the application.(ex. which Lib. we need to use, what kind of naming convention we need to use).

4. `Implement`:
In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.

5. `Test`:
Once the developers build the software, then it is deployed in the testing environment. Then the testing team tests the functionality of the entire system. In this fifth phase of SDLC, the testing is done to ensure that the entire application works according to the customer's requirements.

6. `Deploy`:
The sixth phase of SDLC: Once the testing is done, and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use. The size of the project determines the complexity of the deployment. The users are then provided with the training or documentation that will help them to operate the software.  Again, a small round of testing is performed on production to ensure environmental issues or any impact of the new release.

7. `Maintenance`:
The actual problem starts when the customer actually starts using the developed system and those need to be solved from time to time. Maintenance is the seventh phase of SDLC where the developed product is taken care of. According to the changing user end environment or technology, the software is updated timely.

Few SDLC models:
1. Waterfall
2. Iterative
3. Agile
